# Uncle Frank's Trash Emporium
This is a brownfield project to change an e-commerce site for a trash store into a multitenancy site with 20 stores. The repo for the original project can be found at [Github](https://github.com/vaidashi/uncle_franks_emporium). Oauth login and two factor authentication were also added to the original code base as well as an internal api used in analytics dashboards for business and platform managers. The project spec can be found here [Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot).
